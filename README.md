# 🛡️ Phishing Email Detection – ISCTURKIYE 2025 Submission

This repository contains the implementation of a classification model based on classical machine learning techniques for the detection of phishing emails.  
Phishing attacks carried out via email pose serious security threats to both individual users and institutions.
